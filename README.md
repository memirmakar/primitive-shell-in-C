# linux-shell-in-C
A primitive shell written in C mainly for learning purposes, to eventually be ported to the ESP32 platform.

Uses node structure to parse arguments. Supports running executables, has a few builtins (echo, type, pwd, exit). Supports redirection and pipelines. 

Does NOT support AND, OR operators. 

## To do: Implement Auto-completion, up-down arrow terminal history.
